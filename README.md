####  Applying-Decision-Trees using  DecisionTreeClassifier class for classification problems.
1) Train the classifier on the data using the fit () method and we can make predictions on the data
2) Before making the predictions splitted the data into training set and testing set to avoid overfitting
3) To qunatify the accuracy by compute AUC with the roc_auc_score function. The higher the AUC, the more accurate our predictions
     -  y_true: true labels   
     - y_score: predicted labels
4) Reducing the overfitting by restrict tree depth by adding a few parameters
